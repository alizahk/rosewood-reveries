            "Rosewood Reveries has been my go-to flower shop for many years! I have often bought bouquets for friends and family members on their special occasions, always leaving them in awe. Sometimes when I forget to place an order beforehand due to stress of managing parties or events, the floral delivery plan comes in handy. They almost always deliver on the same day, and if not the day after, which saves me the hassle of finding another store that meets their standards. Overall, I am satisfied with their products and would recommend this store if people are in need of bouquets!" - Ava

            "I was in a panic a few days before my wedding since the florist I had originally booked cancelled last minute. No other stores had custom-made, unique bouquets that would deliver on time. However, I was relieved when a friend recommended Rosewood Reveries to me. Although there was an extra cost for the next day delivery subscription, the first-time subscriber discount and support they offered me made it worth it. Since the moment I contacted them, they were extremely reassuring, and worked with me to create a matching, beautiful bouquet. When my wife saw them, she was filled with joy. I can’t thank them enough for stepping in and helping make our wedding day even special." - Eli
